# ThreeMF
I made this project because I require .3mf support in blender, there was no properly working solution that met my needs, and i wanted to learn blenders api integration. so i kinda nailed a few things off the list...

i can't imagine i'm the only one in need of this, therefor i've left this repo public! Feel free to contribute to my terrible code!

## TODO
- add export functionality
- try abide by [Blender Addon Guidelines](https://developer.blender.org/docs/handbook/extensions/addon_guidelines) best as possible

## Contribute
If you do wish to contribute to the project, i'm not a fussy guy, feel free to submit a pull request and 
if there is anything that I don't approve of, i'll happily refractor it (I doubt i'll ever not approve something though)

## Credits
- [@Keaza] - helped alot with planning and discussion :)
- https://github.com/3MFConsortium/lib3mf - although undocumented, a lovely little .3mf library, taught me alot about the format
- https://github.com/Ghostkeeper/Blender3mfFormat - A similar, however outdated library of which threeMF was initially based on.
- https://blender.stackexchange.com - they're all just absolute GOATS
